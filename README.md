# 📸 Photo Blog (Go + Fiber Backend) 🥑

This is a personal project to **learn Go (Golang)** by building a photo blog with a backend API and later a React frontend.

## 🧠 Why This Project?

I'm using this project to:

- Learn backend development with Go
- Understand how APIs are structured and built
- Work with Markdown and serve blog content dynamically
- Eventually display and manage my photography on a modern web stack
- Practice clean code structure, version control, and deployment habits
